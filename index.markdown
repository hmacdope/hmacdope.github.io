Hi all! My name is Hugo MacDermott-Opeskin and welcome to my blog! I am a graduate of the Australian National University (ANU), where I recieved my B.S.C (Hons) in chemistry, with an advanced chemistry specialization, followed by a PhD in the group of Assoc. Prof Megan O'Mara at the ANU.

I have wide ranging interest and expertise in computational chemistry, as well as research software development and open source science. 

When not tapping away frantically at my computer, you can find my running on my local trails, or playing chess.
